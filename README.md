# PitchSim
## Setting Up
You can either create the `PitchSim` environment with `conda`:\
`conda env create -f environment.yml`

Or use `pip` inside an already created environment:\
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then you should be all set to run `run.py`. WARNING: It will take at least a day to run the full script, especially the `simluate_pitches()` step. I'm currently exploring ways of having the model files and the final dataframe available for download, possibly from Hugging Face.
